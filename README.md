# Novacrust
A simple crypto payment design.


Setup:
This project was created using Vite + React + TypeScript.


Tech Stack:
React
TypeScript
Vite
Tailwind CSS
React Router DOM
React Icons

Project Overview:
The app includes reusable components and page-based routing.
It focuses mainly on UI, form flow, and user experience rather than real payment processing.


Trade-offs:
TypeScript was used for type safety and better code structure, at the cost of slightly slower development.
Tailwind CSS improves development speed and consistency, but results in more utility classes in JSX.
